{"conversations":[{"role":"user","content":"What exactly is a Hub in the context of Farcaster?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"A Hub is a distributed network of servers that store and validate Farcaster data. A computer running the required software can become a Farcaster hub, downloading onchain data from Ethereum and offchain data from other Hubs. Each Hub stores a copy of all Farcaster data which can be accessed over an API."},{"role":"user","content":"How does a Hub validate a message?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"A Hub validates a message by checking that it has a valid signature from one of the user's account keys. Additionally, it ensures the message meets the requirements of its type, such as a public message or 'cast' being less than 320 bytes."},{"role":"user","content":"What happens if there are conflicts when storing a message?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"If there are conflicts, they are resolved deterministically and asynchronously using CRDTs.

Hubs replicate data using a two-phase process: gossip and diff sync. When a Hub receives and stores a message, it immediately gossips it to its peers using libp2p's gossipsub protocol, which is lossy.

Once consensus is reached, the change can be implemented."},{"role":"user","content":"Why does Farcaster avoid having official roles or veto power in its governance?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Farcaster avoids having official roles or veto power to prevent the ossification of systems, politicking, and slowing progress.
